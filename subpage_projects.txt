<p class="section_head" align="center">Project-oriented presentation</p>

<p style="color:white;font-size:1.1vw">During the time I applied for academic positions as well as 
in private organisations I have noticed that the traditional curriculum vitae's form does not allow much information 
to be transmitted, often reduced to "<I>name-dropping</I>". I really think that personnality matters for team 
integration as well as for project management. Hence I take the occasion to present here the way I think about myself 
in terms of important aspects of my personnality, beginning with the most fundamental ones to ones that I developped more recently.</p>

<B>Functional adaptation.</B> Thinking about a human organisation (any human group that gathers people in order to execute a project) as a living organism, 
in which individuals are thought as cells, I like to think of myself as a <I>stem cell</I>, in the sense that I can grow into 
a functional cell in any environment by adaptation. By that I don't mean that I can execute any function efficiently right away, 
but that I can be of particular use in a pre-structured organisation for which the right structure is unknown for the moment.
I believe that is the most fundamental aspect of my personality. Let me talk now about more specific one, that I would like 
to illustrate with examples from my experience.

<B>Problem-solving.</B>
When I was in preparatory school (before entering the &Eacute;cole Normale Supérieure) I had to solve (or at least attempt to do so) 
well-posed mathematical problems for the preparation to competitive exams. Some of them were particularly difficult and despite 
this I most of the time found the solution all by myself, even when most of the other students were stucked. This really stimulated me intellectually and motivated me to enter to the &Eacute;cole Normale Supérieure. I still like a lot to solve difficult problems (when it is significant for my work) an I am not afraid of any challenge. In particular during my PhD thesis I solved some problems that were considered to be very difficult, by developping completely new methods. Since my years at the &Eacute;cole Normale Supérieure, I like 
to think about problems of other natures, such as philosophical and more generally human ones, mainly in my spare time.

<B>Self-reflection.</B> During preparatory school, besides investing myself more deeply and personnaly in my work, 
I begun to think also about the way I worked and the method that I adopted in order to solve problems and learn 
(mainly about mathematics at this time). I wanted to theorize learning methods in cognitive terms in order to provide a foundation for my own method, in order at the same time to sharpen it and communicate it to others. This is another important aspect of my personality 
now since I everytime I work on something (wether it is solving a problem or presenting my work) I care about thinking about 
the way I do it, to the point that I see this as a research matter, that I like to approach during my spare time.
As a consequence when I am facing difficulties in my work I am able to immediately question myself in order 
to overcome the difficulties, in particular when they are of human nature, and I always keep in mind that everywhere I go 
there is something for me to learn about.

<B>Flexibility.</B> During my studies at &Eacute;cole Normale Supérieure I had the occasion to meet interesting persons who 
were brilliant in their respective fields of study, providing me a fresh point of view on them, which made more sense to me that what 
I learnt before. As a consequence I spent a lot of my spare time reading philosophy, history and cognitive sciences 
books and articles, seeing this as a way to test my theory about learning. 
Through this I realized the difference of intellectual culture between disciplines, which 
are shaped by the focus on certain cognitive faculties over others. Since then I cared about understanding culture differences 
but also, as I took the habit to do so, to theorize them. Any different environment is an occasion for me at the same to learn
about another "<I>mindset</I>" but also to enrich my point of view on culture differences and their dependency on cognition 
choices. Moreover this way to see at things makes me able to execute with enthousiasm any task that I am asked to execute, 
since I will find a way to learn something out of it.

<B>Self-learning.</B> At the end of my studies at &Eacute;cole Normale Supérieure I obtained a master in 
fundamental mathematics. Since then I turned away from abstract mathematics, not because 
it was too difficult for me but because I wanted to construct a research program which integrates my other interests 
for philosophy and cognitive sciences in particular. Despite that I believe that fundamental mathematics provided me with 
the ability to deal with highly abstract concepts, and as a consequence to go beyond the assimilation of other intellectual 
cultures but to learn about technical things when needed and in a short time (in particular in informatics), particularly because 
I enjoy it. I like to learn by projects (sometimes I create them artificially for the only purpose of learning), 
meaning focusing on an outcome that I could make use of, collecting tools in order to do it 
and then use these tools in a way that is specific to my project. This way I would be able to re-use the tools I learnt about 
for other purposes. Moreover when I need to learn about anything I don't limit myself to the understanding of this particular thing 
but take the occasion to get as much related information as possible, just to expand my knowledge.

<B>Originality</B>. All along my curriculum I was careful to integrate all the directions I took in learning, thinking 
and reflecting, in coherent mental frame, by making connections between them. For instance I like to think about 
how philosophy considerations can be useful for scientific projects, by examining in depth the concepts involved in the study. 
I think that the intuition gained by this kind of considerations can be of some use in conceiving original ways to approach 
a problem, where more traditional concepts and ways to think may fail to do so. For instance during my doctoral thesis preparation 
I used analogies with biology in order to develop entirely new techniques to solve the mathematical problems I approached 
at this time. More generally I think it is useful to be able to "<I>switch</I>" between a rigour-oriented mindset 
and an intuition-oriented one in order to make faster progress, by alternatively generating ideas for their own 
interest and testing them as potential way to a solution. This is an instance of a way I integrate my consideration 
for assimilating various intellectual cultures and my scientific projects.

<B>Communication.</B> During my doctoral thesis I had to present the results of my research work to other 
researchers during seminars and international conferences. Following the advices of my supervisor, I worked on 
making these presentations as useful as possible for the audience. Following my habit I formulated 
the problem of "communication of information in restricted time" theoretically and tried to find some 
principles on which I could found the construction of any talk. This way I could integrate the intuition 
gained out of my experience in teaching to university students but also my interest for cognitive sciences, 
adapting the form of the presentation to the way the audience "processes" information passively received 
by listening to a talk, for instance by minimising the quantity of information that the audience would 
have to process, guiding the attention towards the way to think about this information, and visualise as much 
as possible (for the visual part of the brain processing information much faster than the one related to language). 
As a consequence of this reflection I am able to transmit complex ideas during limited amout of time, and adapt 
to my audience. For instance I differenciate the way I teach to students during tutorials: 
for the ones who are at ease with mathematics themselves, I usually only provide slight hints on the direction to take. 
For the others I take more time to understand the way they think in order to teach them how to think about a mathematical 
problem in general. This is something I feel passionate about: already in preparatory school after solving myself 
the exercices I liked to spend some time explaining the way to arrive at the solution to the other students.

<B>Perseverance.</B> Sometimes solving a problem is difficult for various reasons: the competition, the tendency to 
abandon because the problem seems too hard, or to disperse oneself in two many different directions. All along my curriculum 
I have been aware of these difficulties and overcame them. For instance every time I have to choose to follow a particular path, 
I restrict myself to decide between not taking this path or following it until the end. I apply this principle to the books I read (or articles or a classes I sometimes follow online): I read it until the end even if I am bored or I don't understand, just because 
it is possible that I will learn something along the way, have new ideas, enrich my thoughts, etc. During my first post-doctoral project I had to deal with other 
difficulties (related in particular to the interdisciplinary nature of the project) but I could not leave it in the middle 
of the way, and decided to continue no matter what: in the end I succeeded. I also choose to go through difficult situations (job research, publications) by not looking at 
the difficulties that are inherent to these situations as essential and related to my person but contingent hardships: 
I choose to see negative feedbacks as an occasion to ameliorate myself by integrating them.

<B>Project construction.</B> Every year I take some time to understand myself and define my project as precisely as possible, 
as well as the way I would like to pursue it. I make this project construction so that I begin the year to 
come in a serene way, giving myself some reasons (derived from project construction) 
to choose and stick to a year-long path. Despite the phenomenon of dispertion at this level, I like, and believe this is important, 
to keep diversity in my interests while constructing actively their coherence in a global vision. For instance I choose 
to get interested in another field of research only if it is related to my project. During this time I try to integrate at a higher level every path that 
I took and see them as part of a whole project, involving personal and professional directions, so that each experience 
enriches the global vision which in return enlightens every experience I have. For instance I like to use 
the concepts I have learnt in sociological theories at the &Eacute;cole Normale Supérieure in order to 
understand group dynamics in my work environment and integrate myself in it ; as well I enjoy observing any other 
aspect of this work environment and in case I identify a problem and think of a solution I don't hesitate to 
discuss about that with the others ; I also like to take the initiative of some projects in work environment (for instance 
I organised a work group during my first post-doctoral year).
