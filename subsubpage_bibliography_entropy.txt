    	<I> This text exposes a characterization of the possibles values of topological entropy for multidimensional 
        	subshifts. This characterization is expressed as a computability condition. On the contrary of unidimensional 
        	subshifts of finite type, the dynamics of multidimensional ones are thus intertwined with computability theory.
        	The construction method is an adaptation of a method developped by R. Berger, and 
        	simplified by R. Robinson, in order to prove undecidability of 
        	non-emptiness of Wang tilings sets.<I>

        	<I> A characterization of projective subdynamics of multidimensional sofic subshifts as effective 
            	unidimensional ones. This construction relies on the implementation of Turing machines in structures 
            	defined through some anisotropic substitution. A particular consequence is of this theorem 
            	is the characterization of possible values of entropy. <I>

            	<I> Here is considered a restriction on multidimensional SFT, namely block gluing, that consists in the possibility to 
            	assemble two blocks, with free choice of relative positions and provided that the distance 
            	is greater than a fixed minimal distance, in at least a configuration of the subshift. This 
            	restriction is proved to strenghten the computability of entropy of bidimensional SFT, and a partial realization is 
           	built that relies on the concept of accelerated Turing machines. Their acceleration relies 
            	on that some operations can be executed in one step using lateral local rules. It is still open 
            	to characterize the values of entropy for multidimensional SFT. Moreover, it is not known if block gluing 
            	restricts the computability of tridimensional SFT. </I>

         	<I> In this text, a symmetry condition on the local rules defining a multidimensional SFT is proved 
             	to strenghen the computability of entropy. This condition covers square ice and dimer model, 
             	and can be seen as a particular case of a form of block gluing. <I>

             <I> The fixed-point paradigm defines a method for the implementation of machines in 
             multidimensional SFT. Basically, the idea is that at each scale, a machine works in order to 
             build macro-symbols that code for the machine at scale immediately above, while doing 
             proper computations. I believe that this construction can be translated into zero-scale constructions 
             (which rely on the Robinson tiling). The machine computations have more impact than 
             in zero-scale constructions, in which some processes rely on geometry. Although they are more involved, 
             their description is more compact. </I>
