<h2> Research interests:</h2>
I am interested in symbolic dynamical systems called <B>subshifts 
of finite type</B> (SFT). These systems are defined 
by the action of the shift on a set of layouts on an infinite grid 
of symbols, where the set of possible symbols is finite. 
    The set of these layouts is 
 defined by local rules (for instance, a symbol can not appear in the 
    neighborhood of another one).
As topological dynamical systems, they 
are studied through concepts of <B>topological dynamics</B>. 
Moreover, their properties are also 
related <B>computability theory</B>, and their study often involves complex constructions that consist in the implementation 
of Turing machines in hierarchical structures that emerge from the local rules. I am interested 
in how dynamical constraints affect these properties and constructions.<br> 
<br> 
    
This provides a formal counterpart 
to the embodied cognition paradigm in neuroscience. 
In a nutshell, the idea is that one can not avoid taking 
into account the various constraints on a computing system 
when it is embedded into reality. Constructions with subshifts 
of finite type under dynamical constraints 
involve numerous mechanisms that adapt computation embedding 
to these constraints. Applying more constraints 
would lead to more other phenomena, that it would be interesting 
to understand in themselves, by asking specific questions.
    
<h2> Ph.D. thesis:</h2>
I defended my thesis at the end of June 2018. 
Here is my <a href="filespdf/these.pdf">
manuscript</a> (in english) and my <a href="filespdf/Soutenance.pdf">
presentation</a> (in french). <br>
<br> 

<B> What is in this text 
which is not in my publications? </B> <br> 
<br>

In give an interpretation of my mathematical problems and constructions 
in biological terms in the <B>Introduction</B> and <B>Comments</B> parts. Second and third chapters provide an introduction 
to subshifts in relation respectively 
with dynamics and computability theory.
