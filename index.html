<h2> Research interests:</h2>
I am interested in symbolic dynamical systems called <B>subshifts 
of finite type</B> (SFT). These systems are defined 
by the action of the shift on a set of layouts on an infinite grid 
of symbols, where the set of possible symbols is finite. 
    The set of these layouts is 
 defined by local rules (for instance, a symbol can not appear in the 
    neighborhood of another one).
As topological dynamical systems, they 
are studied through concepts of <B>topological dynamics</B>. 
Moreover, their properties are also 
related <B>computability theory</B>, and their study often involves complex constructions that consist in the implementation 
of Turing machines in hierarchical structures that emerge from the local rules. I am interested 
in how dynamical constraints affect these properties and constructions.<br> 
<br> 
    
This provides a formal counterpart 
to the embodied cognition paradigm in neuroscience. 
In a nutshell, the idea is that one can not avoid taking 
into account the various constraints on a computing system 
when it is embedded into reality. Constructions with subshifts 
of finite type under dynamical constraints 
involve numerous mechanisms that adapt computation embedding 
to these constraints. Applying more constraints 
would lead to more other phenomena, that it would be interesting 
to understand in themselves, by asking specific questions.

In this text, we expose a study of a computational threshold 
effect relative to the computability of the entropy of bidimensional 
subshifts, according to a quantified version of a mixing 
property on subshifts of finite type (with 
a gap function). The main result 
is an adaptation of the celebrated construction 
by Hochman and Meyerovitch embedding 
Turing computations in multidimensional SFT in order to characterize 
their possible entropies. This result states 
    that the entropies of SFT having a linear 
version of the mixing property are the same as those of SFT without 
   constraint
    . As a consequence, the 
threshold is sub-linear. <br>
This adaptation involves in particular 
a modification of the computing machine implementation, allowing <B>multiple 
heads</B> on the initial tapes and entering on the sides 
of the computing units. The <B>local rules</B> 
of the machine correspond to a function that 
gives the result of <B>collisions</B> between entities 
on the computation positions inside 
the computing units. These entities 
are transported in wires that connect the computation 
positions. The control on the effect of this mechanism 
is rejected to the border of the computing units, and 
involves error signals that propagate on the border.

<br>
Since it is difficult to embed computations 
in sub-linear mixing bidimensional SFT, we studied 
this threshold with Benjamin for a class of 
subshifts which is more flexible: decidable subshifts (whose language 
    is decidable).
We were able to characterize this threshold
with a summability condition on the gap function. 
The proof involves one-dimensional 
subshifts on alphabet {0,1} defined 
by a sequence of restrictions on the possible number
of 1 symbols in length n words for all n. Above the 
threshold, we code subshifts to have non-computable entropy. 
This uses approximation of the change in entropy induced 
by a perturbation in the sequence of restrictions.

of the possible entropy dimensions of minimal Z^3-SFT.</B> [<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.03182">

<br>

In this text, we studied another constraint on 
multidimensional SFT and the effect of this restriction 
on embedding computations in these subshifts. We 
prove that this embedding is still possible 
under this constraint. We adapt a construction by Meyerovitch 
in order to characterize the possible entropy dimensions 
of tridimensional SFT. <br>

This adaptation involves many information processing mechanisms 
that are not observed in other constructions in the literature. 
The main tool is the use of counters that alternates all 
the "random behaviors" that happen in the configurations 
of the subshifts. The value of these counters 
code entirely the behavior of the machines in the computing 
units. They also have a non-coding part and a suspension 
mechanism which allow the counter to have a Fermat number 
as period. Goldbach's theorem ensures that these numbers 
are all coprime. We use this fact to have 
the minimality property. <br>

The division of the counters into a coding part and non-coding 
part confirmed a possible analogy between mechanisms 
observed in these constructions and in the living 
triggered in our first work with Mathieu.

    set by minimal tridimensional SFT.</B> [<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.07799">arXiv</a>].<br>
<br>
    
In this text, we explore further the effect of minimality on "dense" computation. This means that, unlike 
the recent constructions of minimal multidimensional subshifts of finite type by B. Durand and A. Romashchenko, 
which use a sparse way to implement machines into the subshifts in order to ensure the minimality, we keep 
the implementation dense. 

We use the tools developed for the characterization of entropy dimensions of minimal tridimensional 
SFT, in order to provide a simulation theorem of dynamical systems on the 
Cantor sets which is robust to minimality constraint. 

The idea is to encode sequences of the Cantor set in hierarchical structures and make machines control evolution 
of sequences in a fixed direction. One specific aspect of the construction is that it makes appear 
a one dimensional full shift degenerated behavior. We thus developped a way to simulate this, using back Fermat number 
period counters. Moreover, the implementation is done in two dimensional sections, and it needs functional specialisation 
of the computing units in order to not break the minimality.

<h2> Other problems:</h2>

Here are examples of other 
problems I am interested in for which I don't 
have developments (at least yet): <br>
<br>
- provide a classification 
of local rules types in SFT (signals, structures, random 
bits, etc.): these words are used, but there is no 
formal object behind them which are defined in the literature.
There is a first attempt to do this in my Ph.D. 
thesis (second chapter). <br>
<br>
- mesuring the organization property of dynamical systems: 
the entropy is not adapted since it has high 
values for highly chaotic systems and low values for very 
structures ones. Is there some natural invariant 
which has high values for "organized" systems and low 
ones for highly chaotic or structured ones?
