<h3> Uncomputability of entropy (statement 
    of the problem </h3>

Multidimensional subshifts of finite type 
are sets of $d$-dimensional infinite words 
(elements of ${\mathcal{A}}^{\mathbb{Z}^d}$, where $d \ge 1$ 
and $\mathcal{A}$ is a finite set). These objects are studied not only
as topological dynamical systems (in 
the field of symbolic dynamics), but also as statistical physics models 
(lattice models), or as computation models and related to decidability.
An important problem related 
to subshifts of finite type 
is to compute (or understand) their entropy. This quantity 
is interesting from the three point of views, as a topological invariant (in the project of classification of dynamical systems), a thermodynamical quantity, and a quantity of information. \bigskip

While any unidimensional subshift of finite type is described by 
a simple automaton, and thus entropy can be computed uniformly with 
an algorithm, this statement breaks down for multidimensional ones ($d \ge 2$). 
It was already known that there exist some multidimensional subshifts 
of finite type having uncomputable entropy~\cite{HurdKariCulik} (meaning 
that there is no algorithm which on input $n$ outputs 
a rational number which is at distance less than $2^{-n}$ to 
the entropy), but a recent theorem, due to 
M. Hochman and T. Meyerovitch~\cite{Hochman-Meyerovitch-2010}, states 
moreover that the possible values of the entropy of $d$-dimensional subshifts of finite type for any $d \ge 2$ are characterized by a computability condition: 
they are exactly the numbers that can be approximated from above by 
the outputs of an algorithm (without knowledge on the speed of convergence).
The meaning of this result is that the study of these dynamical systems is 
intricated with computability theory. \bigskip

On the other hand, the entropy of very particular simple bidimensional subshifts of finite type has been computed 
(exactly solvable models), such 
as the dimer model and the six vertex model. 
The exact value of the entropy of the hard cores (which consists in a subshift on $\{0,1\}$ defined by 
forbidding two $1$ to be neighbors)
model is still not known, but is computable. 
This comes simply from its block gluing property~\cite{Pavlov-Schraudner-2014} (this property states 
that two observable square patterns can be observed 
in the same element of the subshift in any relative position, 
provided that the distance is greater than a fixed one), but 
a more efficient algorithm was also proposed, based 
on percolation techniques.

The main aim of my research is to understand the 
frontier between uncomputability and computability (in the 
exact and in the algorithmical sense)
of the entropy 
in the class of bidimensional subshifts of finite type.
Eventually, I would like to understand these 
systems in more dimensions, but this problem is very 
hard, and nothing is known. \bigskip

\noindent \textbf{Computational threshold phenomena:} \bigskip

There is no definite way to approach this frontier. 
A particular one is through a quantified version 
of the block gluing property, for which the minimal 
distance of gluing depends on the size of the square patterns.
In this restricted context, approaching 
the frontier means characterizing a threshold 
for this minimal distance of gluing. \bigskip

In a first long article~\cite{GS17}, I studied this directly for bidimensional 
subshifts of finite type, approaching the threshold 
from below, by generalising the computability of 
entropy to $o(\log(n))$-block gluing. Approaching from above, I proved that the possible values 
of the entropy do not change when restricting by 
linear block gluing. In particular, it answers the 
problem 9.1 of~\cite{Hochman-Meyerovitch-2010}.
It is also interesting for other reasons, since 
it provides a combinatorial view on entropy transformation
of subshifts of finite type through particular 
operators on them. Moreover, it provides solutions 
for embedding Turing computation (on which 
the result of M. Hochman and T. Meyerovitch relies) 
under strong dynamical restrictions, under which the construction of M. Hochman and T. Meyerovitch, like other ones of this type, breaks down on several points. For instance, 
I adapted these techniques in two other long 
articles in order to provide a characterization 
of the possible values of another topological invariant, 
the entropy dimension, under minimality restriction~\cite{GS17ED}, and adapt another classical result about 
simulation of effective systems by subshifts of 
finite type to this minimality restriction~\cite{GS18}. \bigskip

The obstacle in fulfilling the gap from above for subshifts 
of finite type comes from the lack of tools for embedding 
Turing computations, since this relies on 
the classical structure of R. Robinson~\cite{R71}, 
which prevents gluing at distance $o(n)$. 
From under, this comes from combinatorial reasons.
In order to understand the frontier in this gap, I considered a more flexible class of subshifts: 
decidable ones. This means that there is an algorithm 
which given a pattern, decides if this pattern 
can be observed in a configuration of the system.
For this class, I were able to characterize 
a threshold for the distance function 
of a quantified block gluing restriction under which the entropy becomes computable and above which 
the set of possible values of entropy is not affected. 
This threshold is formulated as a summability 
condition on the minimal distance function.
The tools involved are combinatorial, and 
an important difficulty was to understand again how certain operators on subshifts 
change the entropy. \bigskip 

\noindent \textbf{Robustness of computation methods:} \bigskip

Another strategy to approach the frontier 
is to consider classical exactly solvable 
lattice models in order to understand what are the 
properties of these models that make their entropy 
exactly computed (and in particular algorithmically 
computable) and extend the class of subshifts for 
which the entropy can be computed (in the exact and 
algorithmical senses), by relaxing these properties. \bigskip

The most interesting of these model, at first sight, 
is the square ice (or six vertex model), 
since it is the conjonction 
of numerous properties that allow computation 
of the entropy through the so-called 
transfer matrix method. My current work consists in 
abstracting these properties and understand the corresponding classes of subshifts of finite type, by finding examples 
and counterexamples in the various classes 
derived from these properties. \bigskip

Further projects could involve various 
other lattice models, such as the eight vertex model, the hard hexagons, or other 
statistical physics objects such as 
self-avoiding walks, providing a point 
of view coming from symbolic dynamics and 
computability theory.
        
        
I am interested in symbolic dynamical systems called <B>subshifts 
of finite type</B> (SFT). These systems are defined 
by the action of the shift on a set of layouts on an infinite grid 
of symbols, where the set of possible symbols is finite. 
    The set of these layouts is 
 defined by local rules (for instance, a symbol can not appear in the 
    neighborhood of another one).
As topological dynamical systems, they 
are studied through concepts of <B>topological dynamics</B>. 
Moreover, their properties are also 
related <B>computability theory</B>, and their study often involves complex constructions that consist in the implementation 
of Turing machines in hierarchical structures that emerge from the local rules. I am interested 
in how dynamical constraints affect these properties and constructions.<br> 
<br> 
    
This provides a formal counterpart 
to the embodied cognition paradigm in neuroscience. 
In a nutshell, the idea is that one can not avoid taking 
into account the various constraints on a computing system 
when it is embedded into reality. Constructions with subshifts 
of finite type under dynamical constraints 
involve numerous mechanisms that adapt computation embedding 
to these constraints. Applying more constraints 
would lead to more other phenomena, that it would be interesting 
to understand in themselves, by asking specific questions.
