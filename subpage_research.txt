				In this text, we relate a computational transition
				effect for the entropy of bidimensional subshifts of finite type for a quantified version of a mixing-type property.
				By computational transition, I mean that when this quantity (the minimal distance of mixing) is 
   				sufficiently small, entropy is algorithmically computable, and it is uncomputable (more precisely, the possible values of entropy
				are characterized as the non-negative numbers that are computable from above)
    				when the quantity is sufficiently large. For the uncomputable area, we ameliorate M.Hochman and T. Meyerovitch's construction (itself 
    				an amelioration of R.Robison's construction embedding Turing computations into a hierarchical aperiodic SFT).
    				In order to adapt the construction to the mixing-type property, we introduce many tools and gadgets that 
    				mainly let Turing machines and all the architecture allowing their implementation to have more chaotic 
    				behaviors. In later constructions on SFTs with minimality property, we re-used these tools. Let us 
     				also note that there is, between this construction and the one of M.Hochman and T. Meyerovitch, an increase in 
    				complexity in terms of interacting gadgets, that brought to my mind the idea of an analogy with biological 
  	  			systems. In my doctoral thesis, I developped this analogy mechanism by mechanism. Besides answering 
    				to the problem 9.1 in the seminal article of M. Hochman and T.Meyerovitch, this construction provides 
    				tools for some problems for which the fixed-point constructions are limited by their use of universal 
    				Turing machines.

			Ideally, we would like to make the transition area more precise for bidimensional SFT. 
			However, this problem seems quite hard, in particular since it is difficult to find 
      			exemples of SFT in this area. With Benjamin, we studied the same problem 
        			for a more flexible class of bidimensional subshifts, those whose language is decidable.
        			With quite some efforts, we were able to characterize a threshold 
         			with a summability condition on the mixing gap function. The proof 
        			involves an ingenius extension of existing arguments for the part below the threshold. 
        			For the part above, we code one-dimensional subshifts on alphabet {0,1} defined 
        			by a sequence of restrictions on the possible number
			of 1 symbols in length n words for all n, making use of an approximation of the change in entropy induced 
			by a perturbation in the sequence of restrictions. <br>

 			The minimality constraint (which forces any pattern to appear in any configuration) 
 			was known to break all the constructions embedding Turing computations into SFTs 
 			on many points. In this text, we achieve an adaptation to this embedding to 
 			minimality constraints. The main idea is to use counters to alternate 
 			all the possible local behaviors of the machines and the embedding architecture. For 
 			this purpose, we needed these possible behaviors to be easily descriptible and determined with 
 			a set of bits that would be part of the counter's state. That is where we re-used 
 			the tools developped for mixing SFT constructions. Moreover, we needed to force 
 			the counter to have co-prime periods, without the use of a Turing machine with 
 			a general formulation (without which we would end in an endless loop of simulation of 
 			the simulation, etc). For this purpose, we introduce in the counter 
 			a non-coding part (triggering an analogy with DNA) and a suspension mechanism 
 			which allow the counters to have Fermat numbers as periods. Golbach's theorem 
 			ensures that these numbers are all co-prime.

			The initial result of M. Hochman and T. Meyerovitch was re-derived afterwards (notably by N. Aubrun and M. Sablik 
			but also by B.Durand, A. Romaschchenko and A. Shen) using a construction 
			simulating effective unidimensional subshifts, which itself can be derived from simulation of effective dynamical 
			systems. In this text, we prove a simulation theorem for effective systems under the constraint of minimality. 
			The construction uses again all the gadgets involded in the previous constructions, with the additional need to 
			separate all the functions implemented in the SFT (in particular the counter function and the computing one) in 
			order to ensure minimality (triggering an analogy with the phenomenon of functional subdivision in biological 
			systems). Another thing to note is that this version of the simulation theorem does not imply the characterization 
			of entropy dimensions. The reason is that one degenerated behavior of the construction that needed to be 
			simulated took the form of a one-dimensional full shift, imposing a lower bound on entropy dimension. 
			Moreover, this theorem is an example of the power of our tools in order to ensure minimality while keeping 
			the embedded computations dense.

			<br>
    
			In this text, I provide a complete proof of E.H.Lieb's statement that square ice entropy is 3/2 * log_2(4/3). Although most of 
			the material was already developped, writting down such a proof was difficult, since the argumentation was partial, 
			but also because of the form of the literature on the subject. I attempt to explain the difficulties that are specific 
			to a mathematical work at the interface betweeen mathematics and physics using the concept of discursive formation, developped 
			by M. Foucault in the Archaeology of knowledge. <br> <br>

                       		In this other article on square ice, I review the Algebraic Bethe ansatz, which provides a method for deriving 
                       		candidate eigenvectors of Lieb transfer matrices of square ice. In particular, 
                       		I prove a formula of V.E. Korepin which leads to an identification with the eigenvectors provided by the coordinate version 
                       		of the ansatz. By contrast with the coordinate Bethe ansatz, 
                       		on which relies the proof of the value of square ice entropy, the elements of this method can be generalized 
                       		to the whole class of nearest-neighbour subshifts of finite type. <br> <br>

		In this text, we export from symbolic dynamics the problem of evaluating the computability of entropy to the more general 
		topological dynamics. We use computable analysis to provide a frame for this problem and prove that the entropy 
                       	of a computable system is always a Sigma_2-computable number. This uniform bound on computability 
                       	leads to the notion of entropy-completeness for classes of dynamical systems, meaning that all Sigma_2-computable 
          		number is the entropy of a system in the class. Considering various class of systems (on the Cantor set or
             		on the unit interval) in general defined by dynamical constraints, we prove else entropy-completeness for some 
         		of them. Otherwise, we characterize the possible values of entropy on the class.

	</p>
     	<p>
		In this text, we consider some combinatorial problem about dominating sets on square grid, where a dominating set is 
                       	a set of vertices such that any vertex has a neighbour in that set. The problem is to count 
                       	the number of possible such sets, given the dimensions of the grid. Providing an exact formula 
            		is quite hard, but we are able to provide some information on the growth rate of this number, according 
            		to the dimensions of the grid. For this purpose, we apply symbolic dynamics tools; in particular, the 
                       	fact that some strong mixing property (namely block gluing with constant gap function) 
                       	for a SFT implies the computability of its entropy.  The comparison of the set of dominating 
            		sets of the grids with admissible patterns of a SFT leads to the existence and computability of a growth rate 
                     	for the number of dominating sets on grids. This work can be seen as an application of symbolic dynamics to some graph problems, and also 
                       	an exhibition of some block gluing subshifts of finite type for which the proof of this property is 
            		not completely trivial. Further exploration of SFT related to domination notions could lead to more
                       	complex examples and maybe some with intermediate gap functions for the block gluing property.
