    <h2> Work group on entropy </h2> 
    
    This year (2018-19), I organize a work group on exact computations of entropies of multidimensional subshifts 
    of finite type at LIP, ENS Lyon. Details <a href="workgroup.html">
here</a>.

    
<h2> Other problems:</h2>

Here are examples of other 
problems I am interested in for which I don't 
have developments (at least yet): <br>
<br>
- provide a classification 
of local rules types in SFT (signals, structures, random 
bits, etc.): these words are used, but there is no 
formal object behind them which are defined in the literature.
There is a first attempt to do this in my Ph.D. 
thesis (second chapter). <br>
<br>
- mesuring the organization property of dynamical systems: 
the entropy is not adapted since it has high 
values for highly chaotic systems and low values for very 
structures ones. Is there some natural invariant 
which has high values for "organized" systems and low 
ones for highly chaotic or structured ones? 

    


<h2> Long term projects: </h2>

I spend a lot of time to read on various subjects: biology, 
philosophy, psychology, etc.
I also like to write and I attempt to build a coherent 
framework based on my notes on many observations and readings (I can provide 
 the current version of my manuscript on demand).
In a nutshell, I am interested in the comparative understanding
of different approaches to knowledge: mathematics, 
alchemy, religion..
