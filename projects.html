            there</a>. It is related to computational threshold phenomena in classes of lattice models in quantum 
        and statistical physics. In this weblog, I will in a more informal way some ideas that I leave informal, hoping 
        to develop them later. <br>

            </p> On the book <I>L'Homme glial</I>, Y. Agid and P. Magistretti: their text presents advances during the last decade 
            in understanding the role of glial cells in the brain, and in particular astrocytes, revealing that these cells 
            are not only auxiliary cells for neurons, providing energy and evacuating lethal excesses of neurotransmitters, 
            but are also fundamental for information processing in the brain. Amongst the functions in which astrocytes are imvolved 
            are for instance the control of neurogenesis, the acceleration or inhibition of neurotransmission, and synchronization amongst 
            groups of neurons. Moreover, they are opposed to neurons in their information transmission mode, thus providing elements for 
            the reflexion on trade-off between wire and diffusive modes in the brain. Since they are involved in computing, one could wonder 
            about the computational power of these cells; this could be put in relation with recent evidence that a simple cell, 
            called Amoebe, can solve some NP-hard problem in linear time [<a href= https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsos.180396>ref</a>].

    [ref:<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3777738/pdf/nihms-513238.pdf">Canonical microcircuits for predictive coding</a>] in terms

<B>2. </B> I spend a lot of time to read on various subjects: biology, 
philosophy, psychology, etc.
I also like to write and I attempt to build a coherent 
framework based on my notes on many observations and readings.
In a nutshell, I am interested in the comparative understanding
of different approaches to knowledge: mathematics, 
alchemy, religion.. amongst many other things.
