        A description of my main research project can be found <a href="filespdf/Researchstatement.pdf">
            there</a>. It is related to computational threshold phenomena related to lattice models and 
        statistical physics. Here I would like to describe other problems I am interested in my work as 
        an academic researcher but also some more free thoughts that I found as well (sometimes more) valuable.
        
<h2> Academic research: </h2>
        
<h3> Conjectures: </h3>
        
        I got interested in symbolic dynamical systems at the end of my master studies through some insanely hard unsolved problems such as Collatz conjecture and 
        the Langton ant. The symbolic version of the first one (through a coding in base two for instance) as well as the second one can 
        be seen as precise statements over long terms behaviors of some symbolic dynamical systems. My interpretation is that they involve 
        a lot of re-writting and understanding their global behavior takes up a lot of information and computations; these computations depend on 
        the initial configuration of the system and can not be done globally, even partially.
        
        I am also interested on other conjectures related to dynamics, computation, and statistical physics: 
        Lonnely runner, Černý, and Furstenberg's x2x3 conjectures ; a conjecture of B. Weiss which states that 
        a multidimensional sofic subshift has a SFT cover with same entropy, the problem of the 
        connective constant of the square lattice.
        
<h3> Formal: </h3>
        
        <B>1. </B> Tridimensional SFT: is the entropy of a block gluing tridimensional SFT computable ? is there 
        an aperiodic one ? with undecidable language ? <br>
<br>
        
        <B>2.</B> What is the entropy of the 
        <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0012365X96001185">Kari-Culik tiling</a>? of square ice ?
        
        <br>
<br>
        <B>3.</B> What are the values of entropy for bidimensional block gluing SFT?
    

        
 <h3> Unformal: </h3>
        
<B>1. </B>  Classification 
of local rules types involved in the description of multidimensional 
        SFT (signals, structures, random 
bits, etc.): these words are used, but there is no 
formal object behind them which are defined in the literature.
There is a first attempt to do this in my Ph.D. 
thesis (second chapter). <br>
<br>
<B>2. </B> Mesuring the organization property of dynamical systems: 
the entropy is not adapted since it has high 
values for highly chaotic systems and low values for very 
structures ones. Is there some natural invariant 
which has high values for "organized" systems and low 
ones for highly chaotic or structured ones? 
    
<h2> Free thoughts:</h2>
        
     <B>1. </B> A comparison of computation embedding constructions of subshifts of finite type and the model of hierarchical predictive coding 
    [ref:<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3777738/pdf/nihms-513238.pdf">Canonical microcircuits for predictive coding</a>] in terms 
    of information processing structures.   <br> 
       <br> 
       
<B>2. </B> I spend a lot of time to read on various subjects: biology, 
philosophy, psychology, etc.
I also like to write and I attempt to build a coherent 
framework based on my notes on many observations and readings.
In a nutshell, I am interested in the comparative understanding
of different approaches to knowledge: mathematics, 
alchemy, religion.. amongst many other things.
