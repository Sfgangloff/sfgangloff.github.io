            there</a>. It is related to computational threshold phenomena in classes of lattice models in quantum 
        and statistical physics. In this weblog, I will present some ideas related the theme of information 
        processing, architectures and dynamical constraints, that I leave informal, hoping 
        to develop them later. <br>

            </p> <B> <br> On the book <I>L'Homme glial</I>, Y. Agid and P. Magistretti </B>: their text presents advances during the last decade 
            in understanding the role of glial cells in the brain, and in particular astrocytes, revealing that these cells 
            are not only auxiliary cells for neurons, providing energy and evacuating lethal excesses of neurotransmitters, 
            but are also fundamental for information processing in the brain. Amongst the functions in which astrocytes are involved 
            are for instance the control of neurogenesis, the acceleration or inhibition of neurotransmission, and synchronization amongst 
            groups of neurons. Moreover, they are opposed to neurons in their information transmission mode, thus providing elements for 
            the reflexion on trade-off between wire and diffusive modes in the brain. Since they are involved in computing, one could wonder 
            about the computational power of these cells; this could be put in relation with recent evidence that a single cell, 
            called Amoebe, can solve some NP-hard problem in linear time [<a href= https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsos.180396>ref</a>], 
            while neurons are thought to execute computation in networks. For symbolic dynamicians, neurons and glia could be thought as forming two 
            superimposed layers of autonomous and interacting computations.

                 <B>On the book <I>L'intelligence humaine n'est pas un algorithme</I>, O. Houdé</B>: the author, motivated by education, draws perspectives 
            for a re-definition of intelligence, articulating the work of central figures of cognitive sciences, J. Piaget, D. Kahneman and A. Damasio, 
            and the mechanism on inhibition. J. Piaget was renowned for his theory on the development of intelligence in the childhood, based 
            on a distinction of stages separated by the acquisition of certain computational mechanisms. In this process, each stage completely overcomes 
            the previous one, as if logics progressively replaces intuitions for a better understanding and adaptation to the environment. D. Kahneman 
            provided another view on intelligence, by stating - an idea that structured all his production - the division of the human brain into 
            two sub-systems: one has fast execution but is sometimes unprecise (it consists of beliefs), and the second one is slow but exact (and 
            consists more of logics). In particular, this contradicts J. Piaget's theory of intelligence stages since the logical and the 
            unlogical coexist in the adult brain, which was shown in experiments by D. Kahneman and collaborators. O. Houdé states himself 
            as in the following of this stream of ideas, and that intelligence is not a matter of how complex thought can be in the brain, 
            but of organisation in the brain. His vision includes a third system which plays the role of an arbitrator between the two 
            other sub-systems, inhibiting the first one to allow the execution of the second one. This third sub-system is 
            related to emotions, thinking them, as A. Damasio, as a guide for reasoning, articulating the two first sub-systems. 
            The author analyses the importance of inhibition in the brain, in particular in visual exploration (return inhibition, 
            notion of M. Posner), and argues that inhibition does not defines consciousness, since there are some unconscious 
            inhibitions (S. Van Gaal's experiments).

     <B>1. </B> A comparison of computation embedding constructions of subshifts of finite type and the model of hierarchical predictive coding 
    [ref:<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3777738/pdf/nihms-513238.pdf">Canonical microcircuits for predictive coding</a>] in terms

<B>2. </B> I spend a lot of time to read on various subjects: biology, 
philosophy, psychology, etc.
I also like to write and I attempt to build a coherent 
framework based on my notes on many observations and readings.
In a nutshell, I am interested in the comparative understanding
of different approaches to knowledge: mathematics, 
alchemy, religion.. amongst many other things.
