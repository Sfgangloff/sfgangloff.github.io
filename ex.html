The next session will take place the <B>5th of October</B>. 
   
    This work group aims 
    at studying exact computations of entropies in statistical physics and provide rigorous tools in order to support 
    the predictions. Moreover, it aims at understanding the conditions of computability (in exact and algorithmic 
    sense) of entropy in multidimensions, without consideration for the physical meaning of the SFT. Thus, we 
    include in our consideration some examples coming from symbolic dynamics, as the Kari-Culik aperiodic shift.
