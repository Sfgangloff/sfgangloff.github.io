In this text, we relate a computational transition
effect for multdimensional subshifts of finite type. 
This transition is between a regime of (algorithmic) computability for the entropy and 
another regime of general uncomputability, according to a gap function 
    in quantified version of mixing constraint.
 The main part of this text is an amelioration of 
M.Hochman and T.Meyerovitch construction, which consists in 
embedding Turing computations in multidimensional SFT in order to exert control 
over areas on which random bits are displayed. This ameliorated cosntruction 
    involves in particular an implementation of the computing machines 
    that allows more chaotic behaviors, allowing <B>multiple 
heads</B> on the initial tapes and entering on the sides 
of the computing units. The <B>local rules</B> 
of the machine correspond to a function that 
gives the result of <B>collisions</B> between entities 
on the computation positions inside 
the computing units. These entities 
are transported in wires that connect the computation 
positions. The control on the effect of this mechanism 
is rejected to the border of the computing units, and 
    involves error signals that propagate on the border.</p>

<br>
Since it is difficult to embed computations 
in sub-linear mixing bidimensional SFT, we studied 
this threshold with Benjamin for a class of 
subshifts which is more flexible: decidable subshifts (whose language 
    is decidable).
We were able to characterize this threshold
with a summability condition on the gap function. 
The proof involves one-dimensional 
subshifts on alphabet {0,1} defined 
by a sequence of restrictions on the possible number
of 1 symbols in length n words for all n. Above the 
threshold, we code subshifts to have non-computable entropy. 
This uses approximation of the change in entropy induced 
by a perturbation in the sequence of restrictions. <br>

<br>

In this text, we studied another constraint on 
multidimensional SFT and the effect of this restriction 
on embedding computations in these subshifts. We 
prove that this embedding is still possible 
under this constraint. We adapt a construction by Meyerovitch 
in order to characterize the possible entropy dimensions 
of tridimensional SFT. <br>

This adaptation involves many information processing mechanisms 
that are not observed in other constructions in the literature. 
The main tool is the use of counters that alternates all 
the "random behaviors" that happen in the configurations 
of the subshifts. The value of these counters 
code entirely the behavior of the machines in the computing 
units. They also have a non-coding part and a suspension 
mechanism which allow the counter to have a Fermat number 
as period. Goldbach's theorem ensures that these numbers 
are all coprime. We use this fact to have 
the minimality property. <br>

The division of the counters into a coding part and non-coding 
part confirmed a possible analogy between mechanisms 
observed in these constructions and in the living 
triggered in our first work with Mathieu.

    set by minimal tridimensional SFT.</B> [<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.07799">arXiv</a>].<br>
<br>
    
In this text, we explore further the effect of minimality on "dense" computation. This means that, unlike 
the recent constructions of minimal multidimensional subshifts of finite type by B. Durand and A. Romashchenko, 
which use a sparse way to implement machines into the subshifts in order to ensure the minimality, we keep 
the implementation dense. 

We use the tools developed for the characterization of entropy dimensions of minimal tridimensional 
SFT, in order to provide a simulation theorem of dynamical systems on the 
Cantor sets which is robust to minimality constraint. 

The idea is to encode sequences of the Cantor set in hierarchical structures and make machines control evolution 
of sequences in a fixed direction. One specific aspect of the construction is that it makes appear 
a one dimensional full shift degenerated behavior. We thus developped a way to simulate this, using back Fermat number 
period counters. Moreover, the implementation is done in two dimensional sections, and it needs functional specialisation 
of the computing units in order to not break the minimality.

     <B>A proof that square ice entropy is 3/2 log_2(4/3).</B> [<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.09274">arXiv</a>].<br>
<br>
    
In this text, I provide a complete proof of E.H.Lieb's statement that square ice entropy is log_2(4/3). Although most of 
the material was already developped, writting down such a proof was difficult, since the argumentation was partial, 
but also because of the form of the literature on the subject. I attempt to explain the difficulties that are specific 
to a mathematical work at the interface betweeen mathematics and physics using the concept of discursive formation, developped 
by M. Foucault in the Archaeology of knowledge. <br> <br>

                       In this other article on square ice, I review the Algebraic Bethe ansatz, which provides a method for deriving 
                       candidate eigenvectors of Lieb transfer matrices of square ice. In particular, 
                       I prove a formula of V.E. Korepin which leads to an identification with the eigenvectors provided by the coordinate version 
                       of the ansatz. By contrast with the coordinate Bethe ansatz, 
                       on which relies the proof of the value of square ice entropy, the elements of this method can be generalized 
                       to the whole class of nearest-neighbour subshifts of finite type. <br> <br>
