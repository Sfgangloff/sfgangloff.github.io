In this text, we relate a computational transition
effect for the entropy of bidimensional subshifts of finite type for a quantified version of a mixing-type property.
By computational transition, I mean that when this quantity (the minimal distance of mixing) is 
    sufficiently small, entropy is algorithmically computable, and it is uncomputable (more precisely, the possible values of entropy
    are characterized as the non-negative numbers that are computable from above)
    when the quantity is sufficiently large. For the uncomputable area, we ameliorate M.Hochman and T. Meyerovitch's construction (itself 
    an amelioration of R.Robison's construction embedding Turing computations into a hierarchical aperiodic SFT).
    In order to adapt the construction to the mixing-type property, we introduce many tools and gadgets that 
    mainly let Turing machines and all the architecture allowing their implementation to have more chaotic 
    behaviors. In later constructions on SFTs with minimality property, we re-used these tools. Let us 
     also note that there is, between this construction and the one of M.Hochman and T. Meyerovitch, an increase in 
    complexity in terms of interacting gadgets, that brought to my mind the idea of an analogy with biological 
    systems. In my doctoral thesis, I developped this analogy mechanism by mechanism.

        Ideally, we would like to make the transition area more precise for bidimensional SFT. 
        However, this problem seems quite hard, in particular since it is difficult to find 
        exemples of SFT in this area. With Benjamin, we studied the same problem 
        for a more flexible class of bidimensional subshifts, those whose language is decidable.
        With quite some efforts, we were able to characterize a threshold 
         with a summability condition on the mixing gap function. The proof 
        involves an ingenius extension of existing arguments for the part below the threshold. 
        For the part above, we code one-dimensional subshifts on alphabet {0,1} defined 
        by a sequence of restrictions on the possible number
of 1 symbols in length n words for all n, making use of an approximation of the change in entropy induced 
by a perturbation in the sequence of restrictions. <br>

 The minimality constraint (which force any pattern to appear in any configuration) 
 was known to break all the constructions embedding Turing computations into SFTs 
 on many points. In this text, we achieve an adaptation to this embedding to 
 minimality constraints. The main idea is to use counters to alternate 
 all the possible local behaviors of the machines and the embedding architecture. For 
 this purpose, we needed these possible behaviors to be easily descriptible and determined with 
 a set of bits that would be part of the counter's state. That is where we re-used 
 the tools developped for mixing SFT constructions. Moreover, we needed to force 
 the counter to have co-prime periods, without the use of a Turing machine with 
 a general formulation (without which we would end in an endless loop of simulation of 
 the simulation, etc). For this purpose, we introduce in the counter 
 a non-coding part (triggering an analogy with DNA) and a suspension mechanism 
 which allow the counters to have Fermat numbers as periods. Golbach's theorem 
 ensures that these numbers are all co-prime.

Mathieu Sablik</a>: <B>Simulation of minimal effective dynamical systems on the Cantor

<br>
    
In this text, we explore further the effect of minimality on "dense" computation. This means that, unlike 
the recent constructions of minimal multidimensional subshifts of finite type by B. Durand and A. Romashchenko, 
which use a sparse way to implement machines into the subshifts in order to ensure the minimality, we keep 
the implementation dense. 

We use the tools developed for the characterization of entropy dimensions of minimal tridimensional 
SFT, in order to provide a simulation theorem of dynamical systems on the 
Cantor sets which is robust to minimality constraint. 

The idea is to encode sequences of the Cantor set in hierarchical structures and make machines control evolution 
of sequences in a fixed direction. One specific aspect of the construction is that it makes appear 
a one dimensional full shift degenerated behavior. We thus developped a way to simulate this, using back Fermat number 
period counters. Moreover, the implementation is done in two dimensional sections, and it needs functional specialisation 
of the computing units in order to not break the minimality.

     <B>A proof that square ice entropy is 3/2 log_2(4/3).</B> <I>Submitted</I> [<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.09274">arXiv</a>].<br>
<br>
    
In this text, I provide a complete proof of E.H.Lieb's statement that square ice entropy is 3/2 * log_2(4/3). Although most of 
the material was already developped, writting down such a proof was difficult, since the argumentation was partial, 
but also because of the form of the literature on the subject. I attempt to explain the difficulties that are specific 
to a mathematical work at the interface betweeen mathematics and physics using the concept of discursive formation, developped 
by M. Foucault in the Archaeology of knowledge. <br> <br>

                       In this other article on square ice, I review the Algebraic Bethe ansatz, which provides a method for deriving 
                       candidate eigenvectors of Lieb transfer matrices of square ice. In particular, 
                       I prove a formula of V.E. Korepin which leads to an identification with the eigenvectors provided by the coordinate version 
                       of the ansatz. By contrast with the coordinate Bethe ansatz, 
                       on which relies the proof of the value of square ice entropy, the elements of this method can be generalized 
                       to the whole class of nearest-neighbour subshifts of finite type. <br> <br>

In this text, we export from symbolic dynamics the problem of evaluating the computability of entropy to the more general 
topological dynamics. We use computable analysis to provide a frame for this problem and prove that the entropy 
                       of a computable system is always a Sigma_2-computable number. This uniform bound on computability 
                       leads to the notion of entropy-completeness for classes of dynamical systems, meaning that all Sigma_2-computable 
                       number is the entropy of a system in the class. Considering various class of systems (on the Cantor set or
                       on the unit interval) in general defined by dynamical constraints, we prove else entropy-completeness for some 
                       of them. Otherwise, we characterize the possible values of entropy on the class.
